# HungerFood

This app is developed to help people who are in hunger. Lots of food gets wasted in restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, etc. Shops can sell these excess products for a cheap price or for free to the consumers. 
Delivery riders can register on the app and deliver foods in their locality and earn some money.
Farmers can use ML tools to predict the price of the crops and this ensures that they can get decent amount for the produce.
